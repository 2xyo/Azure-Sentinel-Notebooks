    "## Configuring your Python Environment\n",
    "### Python 3.6 or Later\n",
    "If you are running in Jupyterhub environment such as Azure Notebooks, Python is already installed. When using any of the sample notebooks or copies of them you only need to ensure that the Python 3.6 (or later) kernel is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running the notebooks locally will you need to install Python 3.6 or later. The Ananconda distribution is a good starting point since it comes with many required packages already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a virtual environment\n",
    "If you are running these notebooks locally, it is a good idea to create a clean virtual python environment, before installing any of the packages . This will prevent installed packages conflicting with versions that you may need for other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For standard python use the `virtualenv` command. For Conda use the `conda env` command. In both cases be sure to activate the environment before running jupyter using `active {my_env_name}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Requirements.txt\n",
    "In Notebooks for Azure you can configure \"Add a requirements.txt\" to the current project. See [this notebook](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel-Notebooks/HowTos/AzureNotebooks-ConfigurePythonVersion.ipynb) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "If running in another environment you can install most of the required packages by downloading `requirements.txt` from the [Azure Sentinel Github](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/Notebooks/requirements.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a standard environment, you can simply run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "to install the requirements or run the following cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing in a Conda Environment\n",
    "Although you can use pip inside a conda environment it is usually better to try to install conda packages whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "activate {my_env_name}\n",
    "conda config --append channels conda-forge\n",
    "conda install package1 package2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Managing packages](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html) in Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "For packages that are not available as conda packages use pip from with a Conda prompt/shell to install the remaining packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing with --user option\n",
    "If you are using a shared installation of Python (i.e. one installed by the administrator) you will need to add the `--user` option to your `pip install` commands. E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pkg_name --user --upgrade\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will avoid permission errors by installing into your user folder."
